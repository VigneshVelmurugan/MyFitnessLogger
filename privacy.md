# Privacy Policy (Personal Use Only)

**Last updated:** 2026-01-04

## 1. Scope
This application is a personal tool that I use to access and review data from **my own Fitbit account only**. It is not offered as a public service and is not intended for use by anyone other than the designated recipient.

## 2. Data accessed
When I authorise the application via Fitbit, it may access only the Fitbit data types (scopes) that I enable for my personal use, such as:
- Basic profile information
- Activity data (e.g., steps, distance)
- Heart rate data
- Sleep data

## 3. How the data is used
- Data is used solely for my personal viewing and analysis.
- Data is not used for advertising or marketing.
- Data is not sold, rented, or shared with third parties.

## 4. Storage and processing
- Data may be stored locally on my personal computer (for example, in JSON/CSV files) to support personal analysis.
- I do not run a public backend service for this application.

## 5. Sharing and disclosure
I do not share Fitbit data with anyone. Data will only be disclosed if required by law.

## 6. Security
I take reasonable steps to protect any access tokens and locally stored data (for example, keeping credentials out of public repositories and limiting access to my device). No method of storage is perfectly secure.

## 7. Retention and deletion
- Locally stored data remains on my computer until I delete it.
- I can revoke the application’s access at any time through the Fitbit account settings.

## 8. Changes to this policy
If I modify the application's handling of my data, I will update this page accordingly.
